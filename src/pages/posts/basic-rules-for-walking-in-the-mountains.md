In my very many years as a 26 years old woman, i can count how many books i have read as an adult. Growing up it was books books books, my dad never failed to buy us books (God rest his gentle soul), he would buy us all sorts of books from fantasy to nature, to gem stones, types of birds in the world, even various historical happenings. So as a child reading was a part of my everyday activity but after my primary education,the only time i read books was when i would save up my luch money to buy romance novels in secondary school. When i was in the higher institution  i didnt do much reading either, even the romance fictions i once loved where no longer a part of my journey, i would only read school work which truly i wasn't reading for the pleasure of it but because it was a necessity.
The reason why i say reading is important is because it exposes you to a whole lof of things i remember when having conversations with people there are things that i'm able to give answers to or certain things that i would know and they didn't all because i read it up somewhere or sometime  ago.
Reading is very much important i recomend everyone to do it, it doesnt have to be all the time but once in a while pick up a book on what concerns your life as a developer or as a manager or as a teacher or it may just be something random, there are so many things that you can read about that will put your life in perspective. One book that i read and always go back to read is THE WAY OF THE SHEPHERD by Dr. Kevin Leman and Bill Pentak it's all about managing productive people but i think it can be applied in our daily live as well. Another book i'm reading at the moment is related to my field (Tech) and it is called The Coding Career Handbook by Shawn Wang.

I'm also taking baby steps to cultivate the culture of reading and i think you should do same too.
