title: How I started My Journey into Tech
excerpt: >-
 A time came when I started to think about where my life was headed and what I was going to about it. I remember speaking to a friend, She's also a developer, and we got talking about all my worries and fears, and somehow I got so much clarity.

I remember the first time I got introduced to web development. I think I was about 17 or 18 years old, I was at the University studying Computer Science, and it was during my first IT placement.  Although I got introduced to it very briefly, I found it fascinating. I remember the software used was **Adobe Dreamweaver** if anyone recalls that software, we're definitely in the same age-group lol. I learned how to apply colors and make table e.t.c

Fast forward to about two years ago, and I realized that most of my friends were either software developers or web developers or even doing something IT related. They were all doing really well. I was envious (in a good way, though) because I wanted to do what they were doing. I said to myself that I can do this too and It's interesting. I was introduced to it briefly years ago, although too many things had changed, I was ready to go for it this time. 

I didn't know that there was so much involved in making a website. I thought it was about adding images, changing colors, and some simple stuff until I decided to go to a school to learn it properly. So yeah, I went to a school to learn web development and my training covered both front-end and back-end development. I paid N120,000 (Naira) and ended up not completing the training because I was distracted. 

At some point, I thought to myself, and I would say, **This is difficult, how I'm I supposed to learn, how do I store all of this information in my head!** I kept doubting myself until I stopped going for classes.

A time came when I started to think about where my life was headed and what I was going to about it. I remember speaking to a friend, She's also a developer, and we got talking about all my worries and fears, and somehow I got so much clarity. 

I decided to pick up from where I stopped, paid for a course on **Udemy** for about N6,000 (Naira). I also started watching YouTube videos and realized that I learn more doing this than when I was in an actual school. **I realized I didn't have to pay so much money to learn when all the materials are online and accessible for free to use**. That conversation I had with my* friend made me understand a lot about where I'm headed, and these are my takeaways:

- **Fear:** It's okay if you feel like you donâ€™t know what you're doing, do it anyways!
- **Determination/Focus:** Determination is very much needed because there's nothing a determined mind cannot achieve, block all the distractions so you can see/hear clearly.
- You can't always know everything: I struggled with this cause I believed that I had to have all of the answers stored in my head, but I have come to realize that train of thought is false. There are so many ways to get information on the internet to help solve your problems. All you have to do is Search! Google is your best friend :)
- Study and practice as much as you can, learn new things.
- Stay updated, insert yourself in the same circle of people that share the same interest. It helps you grow. I'm not saying that you shouldn't have other friends, but it helps a lot if you also have friends who share similar interests. You'll be amazed at how much that helps. Insert yourself in the right social crowd, follow groups if you have to, go for events and meetups.

I have started executing these things, and I have come to realize how helpful they are. It's not easy, don't worry, it'll be worth it soon.
