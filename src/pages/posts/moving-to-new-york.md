excerpt: >-
  A time came where i sat down and i began to think about so many things, about
  where my life was headed and what i was doing about it. I Remember speaking to
  a friend of mine who is a web-developer and talking about all my worries and
  fears and  somehow i got so much clarity.

I remeber the first time i was introduced to web-design i think i was about 17 or 18 years old, i was in University studying Computer Science  and it was during my first IT. Although it was intoduced very briefly but i found it interesting, i remember the software used at the time was "DREAMWEAVER" if anyone one recalls that software we're definitely in the same age-group lol. We were thought how to apply colors make table e.t.c 
Fast forward to about two years ago i relaized that most of my friends where either software developers or Web developers or doing something IT related and they were all doing very well, i was envious (in a good way though) because i wanted to do what they were doing i said to myself, I can do this too it's actually interesting. I was introduced to it briefly years ago although too many things had changed but i was ready to go for it this time. I actually didn't know that there was so much involved in making a website, i thought it was just about adding images, changing colors and the whole simple stuff until i decided to go to a school to learn it properly. So yeah, i went to a school to learn Web-Development which includes Front-End and Back-End design and i paid N120,000 (naira) i ended up not completeing the course because i was distracted, at some point i thought to myself , i would say "This thing is difficult, how i'm i supposed to learn, how do i store all of this information in my head ", i kept doubting myself until i stopped going for classes.
A time came where i sat down and i began to think about so many things, about where my life was headed and what i was doing about it. I Remember speaking to a friend of mine who is a web-developer and talking about all my worries and fears and  somehow i got so much clarity. I then decided to pick up from where i stopped,  paid for a course on Udemy for about  N6,000 (naira ), i started watching videos and i even  learnt so much more than when i was in an actual school, youtube videos also helped,**i relaized i didnt have to pay so much money to learn when most of the materials are Online for free**after constantly discussing with my friend, she made me realize so many things and i'll say this :
1. Fear : It's okay if you feel like you dont know what you're doing, just do it anyways! 
2. Determination/Focus: Determination is very much needed because there's nothing a determined mind cannot achieve, block all the distractions so you can see/hear clearly.
3. You can't always know everything : i struggled with this because i believed that i had to have all of the answers stored in my head but i have come to realize that train of thought is false. There are so many ways to get information on the internet to help solve your problems all you have to do is Search!
4. Study and practice as much as you can, learn new things.
5.  Stay updated, insert yourself in the same circle of people that share the same interest, it helps you grow. I'm not saying that you shouldn't have other friends, but it helps alot if you also have friends that share similar interest you'll be amazed how much that helps. Insert yourself in the right social crowd, follow groups if you have to, go for events and link ups.

I myslef have started implementing these things and i have began to realize how helpful they are .... i won't lie it's not easy, but it'l be worth it.
