My name is Jessica Agorye,  I'm a Web Developer, I enjoy building websites, I also enjoy the challenges involved in acomplishing a task as a Web developer. **One of my favorite quotes is carpe diem which  means "seize the day"**
To me everyday is an oppourtunity to be better and I'm very open to learning new things in my field and as a human all together.

Asides coding, I enjoy watching documenteries about almost anything! I find them very interesting and engaging. I love to write, listen to good music and have a good time overall. Also I'm a food enthusiast, I love to explore/taste different cuisines, I also love to cook and eat too and last but not the least, I enjoy singing and writing music.
