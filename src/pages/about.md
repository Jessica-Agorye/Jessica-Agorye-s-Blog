My name is Jessica Agorye,  i'm a Web-Designer, i enjoy budiing websites, i also enjoy the challenges involved in acomplishing a task as a web-designer. One of my favorite quotes is carpe diem which  means "seize the day"
To me everyday is an oppourtunity to be better and i'm very open to learning new things in my field and as a human all together.

Asides coding, i enjoy watching documenteries about almost anything! i find them very interesting and engaging.  i love to write, listen to good music and have a good time overall . Also i'm a food enthusiast, i love to explore /taste different cuisines,  i also love to cook and eat too!  and last but not the least, i enjoy singing and writing music.
